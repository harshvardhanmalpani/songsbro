# Songsbro
The Infamous Reverse Engineered Framework for Hungama.com


## How to use
- inc.php for basic database auth
- do check the session_id variable in inc.php
- to obtain new var, kindly headover to hungama app and use wireshark. (for detailed tutorial, ping me)
- import the .sql file in db first, that's all. songsbro clone is ready to work.

## Notes:
- *di* directory will store the images, haven't uploaded them here
- rename dot.htaccess to .htaccess
- try yoururl/song/DIGITS to check if it works ( you will see an entry in db plus the image in di folder )
- you are solely responsible for whatever trouble you invite with this code, I am serious about this one.
